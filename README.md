# Soundboard

A good team artifact to have present in a room of developers. Use with your own sounds!

A simple python application that takes a sound (from the sounds folder) started with a letter typed on the keyboard, and plays it. E.g.

Running main.py and see the console showing:
"Ready for input"

```
project
│   README.md
│   main.py
│   startup.mp3    
│
└───sounds
│   │   a_test.mp3
```

Pressing "a" will then play a_test.mp3.

## Getting started
### Windows
Run the command to install python and pip through chocolatey, if not already installed:
```sh
choco install python
choco install pip3
```

Then use pip to install pygame:
```sh
pip3 install pygame
```

Run the application:
```sh
python .\main.py
```

## Sound ideas
Due to koda the sound folder is not very packed. But some ideas to create a nice board could be:
